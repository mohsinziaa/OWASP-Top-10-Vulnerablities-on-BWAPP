# VULNERABILITIES IN WEB APPLICATIONS
<br>The project provides an opportunity to integrate and practice the concepts from the all parts of the course. This is an opportunity to make a real contribution, and develop your portfolio. In this project assignment you will find most critical security risks in a web application.<br>
<i>Note:</i> This project is a group assignment and groups should have no more than 2 members. Students doing this project will get upto 5 bonus points.<br><br>

### <i>Application Installation:</i>
Download the bugy web application (bWAPP) from here. This is a custom Linux virtual machine pre-installed with bWAPP. With bee-box you have the opportunity to explore all bWAPP vulnerabilities. Next, follow the instructions written in INSTALL.txt file after downloading the bee-box.<br><br>

### <i>OWASP Top 10:</i>
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within any organization into one that produces more secure code. Find all the details about Top 10 web security risks here.<br><br>

### <i>Finding Vulnerability in a Web App:</i>
At this moment, you should have installed the bWAPP and gone through Top 10 web security risks with examples explained in the document. Your task is to find all the Top 10 web security risks from the bugy web app and create a comprehensive report.<br><br>

### <i>Project Report:</i>
